      "contents": "\nHow should we think about Human Development\nDefining Development\nSystematic changes and continuities (ways in which we remain the same or reflect elements of our past selves) in the individual that occur between conception and death.\nDevelopment falls into 3 broad areas:\nPhysical Development: Relates to genetic inheritance, growth of the body and organs, functioning of physiological systems, physical signs of ageing and changes in motor functions, etc.\nCognitive Development: The development of mental processes, such as perception, attention, language. learning, memory. intelligence, creativity and problem solving.\nPsychosocial Development: Aspects of the self, and social and interpersonal interactions, such as motives, emotions, personality traits, morality, social skills, and roles played in the family (miniature social experiment) and larger society.\nDomains of Human DevelopmentThese areas overlap, providing opportunities to contribute to each other. In the case of a baby learning to crawl (physical), opportunity is then available for the child to grow by exploring their environment (cognitive) as well as watching different family members interact (psychosocial) and go about their day.\nWhile physical development generally follows the growth-stability-loss model into old age, the belief that all 3 aspects of this development cycle follow the same pattern is largely false, although there are some connections in all three areas via this model.\nDevelopmental change at any age involves both gain and loss. While we gain cognitive abilities as children, we also become less willing to be flexible in our thinking as we age. There may also be a loss of self esteem and a susceptibility to depression. Examples of continued gain into old age is vocabulary, and accumulated knowledge over the lifespan.\nConceptualising the lifespan\nDevelopmentalists largely agree on defined periods of development, in which similar markers can be attributed.\nPeriod of Life\nAge Range\nPrenatal period\nConception to birth\nInfancy\nFirst 2 years of life (the first month is referred to as the neonatal or newborn period)\nEarly childhood\n2 to 5 or 6 years (some refer to children aged 1 to 3 who have begun to walk as toddlers)\nMiddle childhood\n6 to about 12 years (or the onset of puberty)\nAdolescence\nApproximately 12 to 18 or 20 years (or when the individual becomes relatively independent of parents and begins to assume adult roles)\nEmerging adulthood\n18 to 25 or even 29 years (transitional period between adolescence and adulthood)\nEarly adulthood\n20 to 40 years\nMiddle adulthood\n40 to 65 years\nLate adulthood\n65 years and older (some refer to subcategories within this period, such as the young old, old old, and very old, based on age ranges or differences in functioning)\nThe emerging adulthood period has recently been added, but not universally agreed upon by researchers.\nEmerging adulthood is characterised by:\nexploring identity\ninstability: job, relationship, living changes\nfree of obligations to focus on own needs.\n“in between” adolescence and adulthood.\nbelief in limitless possibilities ahead.\nThe 5 traditional markers of adulthood are education, financial independence, leaving home, marrying and having children.\nThe challenge with the use of these markers is that some individuals take longer than others (e.g. - father at 40) to reach them, while others do not pursue these markers at all. Different sections of society view these markers differently, and do not necessarily agree that they are universal for all individuals and cultures.\nAge and Development: Sociocultural perspectives\nCulture is defined as he shared way of life of a people. We learn a system of beliefs, values and practices considered to be relevant in order to function as a part of our culture into adulthood. Culture influences how we live and experience life.\nCultures segregate groups within their societies based on age grade or age stratum. For example, children in year levels at school, retirement age at 65, getting a license to drive at 18 (as well as voting, and consuming alcohol). Each culture has its own way of doing this, and whole societies are layered into age grades. Age grade can change over time, such as the eligibility for the pension, or other cultures defining age grade as a function of motility as the number of years since birth is not accurately recorded.\nAge norms are also defined within cultures to appropriate behaviours. For example, a 6 year old should not drink beer, we should many in our 20s and 30s and should retire at around 65.\nThe social clock is a concept used to describe when certain life events should take place such as marriage, parenthood or retirement. These events can negatively impact an individual when they occur “off-time” (parent after 40), although western based cultures have seen a weakening of age norms.\nStereotypes and ageism are concepts that come about as a result of important life events occurring outside age norms, as they are deemed inappropriate by a culture or society. Examples of these include elderly people seeking employment or education in a prejudicial sense, or the positive assumption that older people will be able to offer advice or assistance in certain situations. Ageism can also be detrimental to children if they are considered to be too young to speak for themselves.\nThe above concepts also differ from one culture to another, based on race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), or standing in society (education, income, or occupational prestige), with members of these stratum often having very different developmental experiences, and poverty being highlighted as significantly detrimental to human development.\nAge and development: Sociohistorical perspectives\nFraming the influence of nature and nurture\nWhat is the science of lifespan development?\nGoals of Study\nEarly Beginnings\nThe Modern Life Span Perspective\nDevelopmental Theories and the Issues that they raise.\nDomains of Human DevelopmentNature Vs. Nurture\nThe nature argument posits that our development is purely based on genetics, and the evolutionary process, and holds that most developmental milestones are universal.\nThe nurture argument posits that our physical (crowding, pollution, etc.) and social environments (friends, family, society and culture) play a primary role in our development over the course of a lifetime.\nActivity and Passivity\nPlaying an active role in the progress of our own development such as self directed learning and curiosity, and manifesting our own development, which, in turn, assists in furthering our development.\nPassivity is determined as an external forces beyond an individual’s control shaping their development, suggesting that a child’s academic failings may be the responsibility of parents and/or teachers.\nContinuity and Disconinuity\nThis issue looks at the gradual and quantitative modes (continuity) of development such as the visible signs of ageing, as opposed to larger, qualitative changes (discontinuity) such as growth spurts, and other changes at puberty.\nUniversality and Context Specificity\n\n\n\n",
