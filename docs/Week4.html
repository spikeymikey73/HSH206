<td>Alcohol</td>
<td>Heavy prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in a cluster of symptoms referred to as foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), in which affected children have a small head and distinctive facial abnormalities, and physically lag behind their peers. Intellectual disability, heart defects, and other cognitive and behavioural problems (e.g. ADHD, conduct disorder) are also common in children with FAS. Some children exposed to alcohol prenatally may not develop all the features of FAS but may experience milder physical, behavioural or cognitive problems (Kodituwakku &amp; Kodituwakku, 2014; Nulman, Ickowicz, Koren, &amp; Knittel-Keren, 2007).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Tobacco</td>
<td>Babies of smokers tend to be small and premature, have respiratory problems, and sometimes show intellectual deficits or behavioural problems later in development (Campos, Bravo, &amp; Eugenin, 2009; Meyer et al., 2009; Stene-Larsen, Borge, &amp; Vollrath, 2009). Smoking and secondhand smoke in the pregnant woman’s environment can increase her risk of miscarriage (George, Granath, Johansson, Annerén, &amp; Cnattinguis, 2006).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Stimulants</td>
<td>Caffeine, found in coffee, tea and many sodas, is a stimulant and diuretic. As such, it can increase blood pressure, heart rate and urination. Heavy caffeine use has been linked to miscarriages, higher heart rates, growth restriction and irritability at birth, but does not seem to have long-lasting effects on development (Loomans et al., 2012).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Antiepileptic Drugs</td>
<td>Some drugs used to treat seizures are associated with substantial risk of restricted growth, microcephaly, heart defects, neural tube defects, kidney disease, and cleft lip and palate. Newer antiepileptic drugs have lower malformation rates (Veiby, Daltveit, Engelsen, &amp; Gilhus, 2014).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Aspirin / Ibuprofen</td>
<td>An occasional low dose is okay, but used in large quantities, such drugs may cause neonatal bleeding and gastrointestinal discomfort. Large amounts of these over-the-counter pain relievers have been associated with low birth weight, prematurity and increased risk of miscarriage (Rebordosa, Kogevinas, Bech, Sørensen, &amp; Olsen, 2009).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Sex Hormones</td>
<td>Birth control pills containing female hormones have been known to produce heart defects and cardiovascular problems, but today’s pill formulas are safer. Progesterone in drugs used to prevent miscarriage may masculinise the foetus. Diethylstilboestrol, once prescribed to prevent miscarriage, increases the risk of cervical cancer and creates infertility and pregnancy problems in exposed daughters (DES Action, 2013).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Marijuana</td>
<td>Heavy use of marijuana has been linked to premature birth, low birth weight and mild behavioural abnormalities such as irritability at birth. It may lead to small deficits in general intelligence as well as in some of the skills that contribute to higher-level problem solving, including sustained attention and cognitive flexibility (Wendell, 2013).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Narcotics</td>
<td>Addiction to heroin, codeine, methadone or morphine increases the risk of premature delivery and low birth weight. The newborn is often addicted and experiences potentially fatal withdrawal symptoms (e.g. vomiting and convulsions). Longer-term cognitive deficits are sometimes evident (Shepard &amp; Lemire, 2010).</td>

<td>AIDS</td>
<td>AIDS, an illness caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), destroys the immune system, increases susceptibility to infections and may lead to death. Mothers can acquire it through sexual contact, or contact with contaminated blood, and can transmit the virus to their babies (1) prenatally through the placenta, (2) perinatally through blood exchange between mother and child as the umbilical cord and placenta separate, or (3) postnatally during breastfeeding. About 15–35 per cent of babies born to HIV-infected mothers will become infected, but risk is reduced if mother and child are provided with drug treatment or the infant is bottle-fed (Avert, 2012; Becquet et al., 2012).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Chlamidia</td>
<td>Chlamydia can lead to premature birth, low birth weight, eye inflammation or pneumonia in newborns. This most common STI is easily treatable.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Gonorrhoea</td>
<td>This STI attacks the eyes of the child during birth; blindness is prevented by administering silver nitrate eye drops to newborns.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Herpes simplex (genital herpes)</td>
<td>This disease may cause eye and brain damage or death in the first trimester. Mothers with active herpes are advised to undergo caesarean deliveries to avoid infecting their babies during delivery, because 85 per cent of infants born with herpes acquire the virus during passage through the birth canal.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Syphilis</td>
<td>Untreated syphilis causes miscarriage or stillbirth in 6 per cent of cases (CDC, 2012). For live births, it can cause serious birth defects such as blindness, deafness, heart problems or brain damage. Prior to the 18th prenatal week syphilitic organisms cannot cross the placental barrier, therefore it is most damaging in the middle and later stages of pregnancy. Even with appropriate penicillin treatment some infants are infected or die (Blencowe, Cousens, Kamb, Berman, &amp; Lawn 2011).</td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Cytomegalovirus</td>
<td>This common infection shows mild flu-like symptoms in adults. About 25 per cent of infected newborns develop hearing or vision loss, intellectual disability or other impairments, and 10 per cent develop severe neurological problems or even die.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Diabetes</td>
<td>Well-controlled diabetes typically poses few, if any, prenatal complications. However, poorly controlled diabetes can lead to premature delivery, stillbirth or miscarriage; immature lung development; and large-for-date foetuses, which can complicate delivery.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Flu</td>
<td>The more powerful strains can cause spontaneous abortions or neural abnormalities early in pregnancy that may lead to decreased intelligence scores in adulthood (Eriksen, Sundet, &amp; Tambs, 2009).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Rubella (German Measles)</td>
<td>Rubella infection is most dangerous during the first trimester, a sensitive period when the eyes, ears, heart and brain are rapidly forming. Birth defects, such as vision and hearing loss, intellectual disability, heart defects, cerebral palsy and microcephaly, occur in 60–85 per cent of babies exposed to the disease in the first 2 months of pregnancy, 50 per cent in the third month, and 16 per cent in the fourth or fifth months (Kelley-Buchanan, 1988). Nearly 15 per cent of pregnant women with rubella experience miscarriage or foetal death (Andrade et al., 2006). Doctors recommend that women should not try to become pregnant unless they have been immunised against rubella or have previously had it.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Toxaemia</td>
<td>The mildest form of toxaemia, pre-eclampsia, affects about 5 per cent of mothers in the third trimester, causing high blood pressure and rapid weight gain in the mother. Untreated, pre-eclampsia may become eclampsia and cause maternal convulsions and coma, and death of the mother, the unborn child or both. Surviving infants may be brain damaged.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Toxoplasmosis</td>
<td>This illness, caused by a parasite in raw meat and cat faeces, leads to blindness, deafness and intellectual disability in approximately 40 per cent of infants born to infected mothers. So, it is recommended that pregnant women avoid eating undercooked meat and do not clean out cat litter boxes, or have cats tested and treated before pregnancy to eliminate potential exposure to parasites.</td>

<td>Radiation</td>
<td>Clinical doses of radiation, such as those used in X-rays and cancer treatment, can cause mutations, spontaneous abortions and a variety of birth defects, especially if the mother is exposed in weeks 8–15. Therefore, expectant mothers are routinely advised to avoid X-rays unless they are essential to their own survival, as might be the case with women undergoing certain cancer treatments.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Lead</td>
<td>Children exposed to lead prenatally are smaller at birth and may be born preterm (Jelliffe-Pawlowski, Miles, Courtney, Materna, &amp; Charlton, 2006). They also show impaired intellectual functioning as infants proportional to the amount of lead in their umbilical cords, even after controlling for other differences among children, such as socioeconomic status (Yorifuji, Debes, Weihe, &amp; Grandjean, 2011). Avoiding exposure to older-style lead-based paints (e.g. dust from old paint during home renovations or ingestion of paint chips from old painted surfaces) is recommended, as exposure to even very low levels of lead can affect mental function.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Mercury</td>
<td>Mercury exposure prenatally typically results from eating fish. Studies looking at prenatal exposure to mercury from maternal consumption of fish suggest adverse consequences, including delayed development and memory, attention and language problems, with the effects commensurate with the amount of mercury exposure (Paulson, 2013). It is recommended that expectant mothers be cautious of eating some fish, namely those larger fish that consume lots of little fish, as these tend to have higher concentrations of mercury.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Pesticides, dioxins, and<br />polychlorinated biphenyls</td>
<td>Prenatal exposure to pesticides, dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has also been associated with perinatal and postnatal problems (Govarts et al., 2012). For example, prenatal exposure to PCBs from maternal consumption of contaminated foods is associated with poor reflexes in infants and later learning difficulties, including lower IQ scores at age 9 (Paulson, 2013). Children whose mothers were exposed to pesticides during pregnancy have greater body fat relative to children not exposed (Wohlfahrt-Veje et al., 2011); exposed boys have smaller genitals, and exposed girls experience earlier breast development compared to non-exposed girls (Wohlfahrt-Veje et al., 2012a; Wohlfahrt-Veje et al., 2012b). Expectant mothers should avoid substances such as PCBs and pesticides.</td>
