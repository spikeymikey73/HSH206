  <tr>
    <td>Birth to 1</td>
    <td>Oral</td>
    <td>Libido is focused on the mouth as a source of pleasure. Obtaining oral gratification from a mother figure is critical to later development.</td>
    <td>Trust vs mistrust</td>
    <td>Infants must learn to trust their caregivers to meet their needs. Responsive parenting is critical.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 to 3</td>
    <td>Anal</td>
    <td>Libido is focused on the anus, and toilet training creates conflicts between the child’s biological urges and society’s demands.</td>
    <td>Autonomy vs shame and doubt</td>
    <td>Children must learn to be autonomous (to assert their wills and do things for<br>themselves) or they will doubt their abilities.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3 to 6</td>
    <td>Phallic</td>
    <td>Libido centres on the genitals. Resolution of the Oedipus or the Electra complex results in identification with the same-sex parent and development of the<br>superego.</td>
    <td>Initiative vs guilt</td>
    <td>Preschoolers develop initiative by devising and carrying out bold plans, but they must learn not to impinge on the rights of others.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6 to 12</td>
    <td>Latent</td>
    <td>Libido is quiet; psychic energy is invested in schoolwork and play with same-sex friends.</td>
    <td>Industry vs inferiority</td>
    <td>Children must master important social and academic skills and keep up with their peers; otherwise, they will feel inferior.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>12 to 20</td>
    <td rowspan="4">Genital</td>
    <td rowspan="4">Puberty reawakens the sexual instincts as youths seek to establish mature sexual relationships and pursue the biological goal of reproduction.</td>
    <td>Identity vs role confusion</td>
    <td>Adolescents ask who they are and must establish social and vocational identities; otherwise, they will remain confused about the roles they should play as adults.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>20 to 40</td>
    <td>Intimacy vs isolation</td>
    <td>Young adults seek to form a shared identity with another person, but may fear intimacy and experience loneliness and isolation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>40 to 65</td>
    <td>Generativity<br>vs<br>stagnation</td>
    <td>Middle-aged adults must feel that they are producing something that will outlive them, either as parents or as workers; otherwise, they will become stagnant and self-centred.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>65+</td>
    <td>Integrity vs despair</td>
    <td>Older adults must come to view their lives as meaningful to face death without worries and regrets.</td>
