### Psychoanalytic

#### Freud: Psychoanalytic theory

>_The id communicates its basic needs, the ego restrains the impulsive id long enough to find realistic ways to satisfy these needs, and the superego decides whether the ego’s problem-solving strategies are morally acceptable._
>
>**Psychoanalytic Theory**: The theoretical perspective that emphasises the >importance of unconscious motivations, emotional conflicts and early experiences >for shaping personality and behaviour.
>
>**Instincts**: Inborn biological forces assumed to motivate behaviour.
>
>**Unconscious Motivation**: The power of instincts and other inner forces, such >as feelings and conflicts, which influence thinking and behaviour without >awareness.
>
>**id**: The inborn component of the personality that is driven by impulsive, >irrational and selfish urges.
>
>**ego**: The rational component of the personality that seeks to satisfy urges >in a realistic manner.
>
>**superego**: The component of the personality that consists of the individual’s >internalised moral standards.
>
>**libido**: Psychic energy of the sex instinct.
>
>**psychosexual stages**: Freud’s five stages of development (oral, anal, >phallic, latency and genital) associated with biological maturation and shifts >in the libido.
>
>**identification**: with same sex parent – by taking on his mother / father’s >attitudes and behaviours, which are part of the superego.
>
>**fixation**: Defence mechanism in which development is arrested and part of the >libido remains tied to an early stage of development (arrested development).
>
>**Oedipus / Electra Complex**: Psychic conflict that 3 - 6 year old boys/girls >experience when they develop an incestuous desire for their mothers/fathers and >a jealous and hostile rivalry with their fathers.
>
>**Regression**: A defence mechanism (similar to fixation or identification) of >retreating to an earlier period of development to avoid anxiety and discomfort >at a higher level, allowing us to function despite anxiety.



#### Erikson: Psychosocial theory

> In contrast to Freud's theory, Erikson focussed more on:
>
> - the social impact of development rather than sexual,
> - rational development rather than selfish and irrational,
> - activity and the ability for people to adapt to, or overcome damaging early experiences, and
> - the notion that development continued after adolescence.
>

> In comparison to Freud:
>
> _"Upward in consciousness, outward to the social world and forward throughout the lifespan"_
>

> **psychosocial stages**: Erikson’s eight stages of development (trust, autonomy, initiative, industry, identity, intimacy, generativity and integrity), which emphasise social over maturational influences as drivers of development.

| Age Range  | Stage                       | Description                                                                                                                                                          | Stage                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Birth to 1 | Oral                        | Libido is focused on the mouth as a source of pleasure. Obtaining oral gratification from a mother figure is critical to later development.                          | Trust vs mistrust             | Infants must learn to trust their caregivers to meet their needs. Responsive parenting is critical.                                                                            |
| 1 to 3     | Anal                        | Libido is focused on the anus, and toilet training creates conflicts between the child’s biological urges and society’s demands.                                     | Autonomy vs shame and doubt   | Children must learn to be autonomous (to assert their wills and do things for themselves) or they will doubt their abilities.                                                  |
| 3 to 6     | Phallic                     | Libido centres on the genitals. Resolution of the Oedipus or the Electra complex results in identification with the same-sex parent and development of the superego. | Initiative vs guilt           | Preschoolers develop initiative by devising and carrying out bold plans, but they must learn not to impinge on the rights of others.                                           |
| 6 to 12    | Latent                      | Libido is quiet; psychic energy is invested in schoolwork and play with same-sex friends.                                                                            | Industry vs inferiority       | Children must master important social and academic skills and keep up with their peers; otherwise, they will feel inferior.                                                    |
| 12 to 20   | Genital                     | Puberty reawakens the sexual instincts as youths seek to establish mature sexual relationships and pursue the biological goal of reproduction.                       | Identity vs role confusion    | Adolescents ask who they are and must establish social and vocational identities; otherwise, they will remain confused about the roles they should play as adults.             |
| 20 to 40   |                             |                                                                                                                                                                      | Intimacy vs isolation         | Young adults seek to form a shared identity with another person, but may fear intimacy and experience loneliness and isolation.                                                |
| 40 to 65   |                             |                                                                                                                                                                      | Generativity vs stagnation    | Middle-aged adults must feel that they are producing something that will outlive them, either as parents or as workers; otherwise, they will become stagnant and self-centred. |
| 65+        |                             |                                                                                                                                                                      | Integrity vs despair          | Older adults must come to view their lives as meaningful to face death without worries and regrets.                                                                            |
